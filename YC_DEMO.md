# AIGEN Y Combinator Demo Script

## **Opening Pitch (30 seconds)**

"AIGEN is an AI-native blockchain with a revolutionary Proof-of-Intelligence consensus mechanism. Instead of wasteful hashing, miners perform useful AI work. What makes us unique is our Genesis CEO Key - immutable control that ensures network safety while enabling rapid innovation. Watch me initialize the entire ecosystem in under 5 minutes."

---

## **Demo Setup (Prerequisites - mention briefly)**

- Rust toolchain installed
- Docker Desktop running
- Project cloned and ready

---

## **Step 1: Build the Blockchain (1 minute)**

```powershell
# Show project structure first
Get-ChildItem

# Build the entire blockchain
cargo build --release

# "This compiles our entire L1/L2 blockchain with AI consensus built-in"
```

**Expected Output:** `Finished release profile [optimized] target(s)`

---

## **Step 2: Single Node Quick Start (30 seconds)**

```powershell
# Initialize first node
cargo run -p node --bin node -- init --node-id yc-demo

# Start the node (in new terminal)
cargo run -p node --bin node -- start
```

**Talking Points:**
- "Each node can run AI inference workloads"
- "Built-in RPC API for easy integration"
- "Genesis CEO controls are hardcoded into consensus"

---

## **Step 3: Test Core Features (1 minute)**

```powershell
# Test blockchain RPC
$body = @{
    jsonrpc = "2.0"
    id = 1
    method = "getChainInfo"
    params = @()
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:9944" -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body $body
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "chain_id": 13044767616725935409,
    "height": 0,
    "shutdown_status": false,
    "total_supply": 0
  }
}
```

**Talking Points:**
- "Chain ID: 13044767616725935409 - our unique identifier"
- "Genesis CEO can shutdown entire network if needed"
- "Zero inflation until CEO activates tokenomics"

---

## **Step 4: AI Model Integration (1 minute)**

```powershell
# Initialize AI worker node
cargo run -p node --bin node -- init --node-id ai-worker --model mistral-7b --role worker

# Start AI worker (in new terminal)
cargo run -p node --bin node -- start
```

**Expected Output:**
```
loading core model: mistral-7b
downloading 4 missing shards for core model
core model loaded successfully: mistral-7b
core AI model ready for inference
```

**Talking Points:**
- "Nodes automatically download and verify AI model shards"
- "Proof-of-Intelligence means miners run actual AI inference"
- "Models are sharded across network for redundancy"

---

## **Step 5: Multi-Node Network (1.5 minutes)**

```powershell
# Quick multi-node setup
cd docker

# Build and start 5-node network
docker build -t aigen-node:latest ..
docker-compose up -d

# Show network status
docker ps
```

```powershell
# Test all nodes
$ports = @(9944, 9945, 9946, 9947, 9948)
$nodeNames = @("Bootstrap", "Full-1", "Full-2", "Miner", "Validator")

for ($i = 0; $i -lt $ports.Length; $i++) {
    try {
        $body = @{jsonrpc="2.0";id=$i;method="getChainInfo";params=@()} | ConvertTo-Json
        $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:$($ports[$i])" -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body $body
        Write-Host "$($nodeNames[$i]): Height $($response.result.height)" -ForegroundColor Green
    } catch {
        Write-Host "$($nodeNames[$i]): Starting..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
    }
}
```

**Talking Points:**
- "5-node network: bootstrap, full nodes, miner, validator"
- "Each node has different roles in the AI economy"
- "Network achieves consensus through AI work verification"

---

## **Step 6: AI Inference Demo (1 minute)**

```powershell
# Test AI chat completion
$body = @{
    jsonrpc = "2.0"
    id = 1
    method = "chatCompletion"
    params = @{
        messages = @(
            @{role = "user"; content = "What is AIGEN blockchain?"}
        )
        model_id = "mistral-7b"
        stream = $false
    }
} | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:9944" -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body $body
```

**Expected Response:** AI-generated explanation of AIGEN

**Talking Points:**
- "This response was generated by our blockchain network"
- "Each inference request is a transaction on-chain"
- "Miners get rewarded for verifying AI computations"

---

## **Step 7: CEO Control Demonstration (30 seconds)**

```powershell
# Show CEO controls (read-only for demo)
$body = @{jsonrpc="2.0";id=1;method="getCEOStatus";params=@()} | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:9944" -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body $body
```

**Talking Points:**
- "CEO wallet: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001"
- "Can veto any system upgrade, emergency shutdown"
- "Ensures network safety while enabling innovation"
