## 1. Immediate Protection Strategies (FREE)

### 1.1 Establish Priority Date Immediately

#### **What This Means**
- Creates legal proof of when you invented your technology
- Critical for defending against later patent filings
- Costs nothing but requires proper documentation

#### **How to Do It (FREE)**
1. **Create Detailed Invention Disclosure**
   - Write comprehensive technical description
   - Include diagrams, flowcharts, and code snippets
   - Date and sign every page
   - Have a witness sign and date

2. **Use Digital Timestamps**
   - Email documents to yourself (showing timestamp)
   - Use GitHub commits with detailed descriptions
   - Post to technical forums with timestamp
   - Use blockchain timestamping services (some free)

3. **Document Development Process**
   - Keep detailed development logs
   - Save all code versions with dates
   - Document problems and solutions
